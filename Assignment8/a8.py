    # To test the code of Problem-1, You may not run it directly in VSC (due to File not found error),
    # please follow the instructions below.

    # 1. Open a new Terminal in VSC.

    # Run the below command in the terminal i.e. after typing in the command, hit enter
    # 2. cd Assignment8

    # Now run the a8.py in the newly opened terminal i.e. type the below command and hit enter
    # 3. python3 a8.py

    # It should print output on the terminal based on how much of the problem have you completed. Using this way
    # of running, you can easily monitor your progress on this problem.
