## Code Review & style (50/50 pts)

Here we look at your code to check for proper style and legibility.
1. Your code has to meet the requirements described in the homework pdf file.
2. It has to be a proper python code.
3. Your logic has to be correct.
4. You may pass our test cases but lose points in this section.
5. You may also fail test cases but get points in this section if your code is reasonable at some degree.

- Problem 1:
    - `factorial`: 16.66/16.66
    - TA Comments: Good work.


- Problem 2:
    - `gl`: 16.66/16.66
    - TA Comments: Good work.

- Problem 3:

    - TA Comments: Good work.


- Problem 4:
    - `ss`: 0/16.66
    - TA Comments: No code pushed.

- Problem 5:
    - `lst_replace`: 16.66/16.66
    - TA Comments: Your code is partially correct.
    You don't need to make an new list and append rather you can replace the number with the item. Please find the example code to understand better. 
    def lst_replace(old,new,lst):
    for i in lst:
        for j in range(len(i)):
            if i==old:
                i=new
            elif i[j]==old:
                i[j]=new
    return lst


- Problem 6:
    - `foo`: 0/16.66
    - TA Comments: No code pushed.
