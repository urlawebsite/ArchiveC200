# CSCI-C 200 Assignment Repository

Do not move or rename any files or folders that are created for you in your repository. Doing so either through GitHub or on your local machine will prevent the grading system from finding your code for review and scoring. **Assignment** files should never be moved or renamed. 

You may create new folders and Python files for additional work, notes, labs, etc. that you wish to work on.
