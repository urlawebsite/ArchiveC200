# Uncomment the below code to see the graphical output cretaed by Pygame
# You are expected to understand the code because this will be needed in the next HW

# If the code does not run in VSC (and complaints about pygame module not found) then you can also run it
# by changing the directory to Assignment6 and running it manually as follows:

# Open a new Terminal in VSC (change directory to Assignment6)
# cd Assignment6 (cd command is used to change directory to Assignment6)

# Run the a6.py as follows
# python3 a6.py (you have already seen this before in labs)

# This should show the pygame window with a triangle

# REMEMBER TO COMMENT ALL CODE FOR PROBLEM 10 before submitting to AUOTOGRADER (only for problem 10).
# Otherwise, it would return with an error. This is because the Autograder can't run graphical outputs for you
# as of now.

# So, once you are understand the code, have run it a few times, comment it back.

# For some of you, at-first it may be puzzling that nothing is happening, look out for a small
# graphical window, it may show behind your VSC window, so you may have to minimize VSC to look at it.
# Press the 'cross' button to close that window.

# REMEMBER TO COMMENT ALL CODE FOR PROBLEM 10 before submitting to AUOTOGRADER (only for problem 10).
