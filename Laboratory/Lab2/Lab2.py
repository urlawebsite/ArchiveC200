    You are a member of the Star Fleet space-travel law enforcement in the world of Star Trek.
    You have caught a ship -- the USS Enterprise -- speeding in the past, and you wish to catch
    them again.  The legal warp speed is 3 -- anything above this and you need to notify your
    superiors.  Write a function which signals whenever warp speed detected is above 3.

        pos1 - the initial position of the spaceship
        pos2 - the final position of the spaceship
